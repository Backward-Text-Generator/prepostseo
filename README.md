Backward text is created by writing in the direction in which the reverse of the natural way is for a given language, so the effect is the mirror image of normal writing. When mirrored in a mirror, it appears natural. Often, it is used as a code that is highly primitive.
Mirrored text may be handwritten by certain individuals. Leonardo da Vinci wrote much of his personal notes in this manner, in particular. The calligraphy of mirror writing was common in the Ottoman Empire, where mystical comparisons were often carried out.

On the ambulance front, a typical modern usage of mirror writing can be seen where the word “AMBULANCE” is always written in the very broad mirrored text so that drivers can see the word the correct way around in their rear-view mirror.
